## Installation

To install this extension:

1.  **Download the code:**
    *   **Option A: Clone the repository (recommended for developers):**
        ```bash
        git clone <repository_url>
        ```
        (Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the Git repository.)
    *   **Option B: Download as ZIP:**
        Download the latest release or the source code as a `.zip` file from the project's repository page (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). Unzip the file to a local directory.
2.  **Open your browser's extension management page:**
    *   **Chrome:** Go to `chrome://extensions`
    *   **Edge:** Go to `edge://extensions`
    *   **Brave:** Go to `brave://extensions`
    *   **Firefox:** Go to `about:addons` (then click the gear icon and "Install Add-on From File..." for a `.zip` or "Debug Add-ons" for unpacked)
3.  **Enable Developer Mode:** Toggle on "Developer mode" (usually in the top right corner).
4.  **Load Unpacked:** Click on "Load unpacked" (or "Load temporary add-on" for Firefox) and select the cloned/downloaded `command-bar-extension` directory.

The extension should now be installed and active in your browser.

## Usage

### Toggling the Command Bar
